# Tensai Bakabon (Sega Master System): Manual English Translation

## About
This repository manual resources for an English translation of Tensai Bakabon for the Sega Master System. Much thanks to Sega Retro for the scans of the manual. Check out the original scans here:
[https://segaretro.org/File:TensaiBakabonSMSJPManual.pdf](https://segaretro.org/File:TensaiBakabonSMSJPManual.pdf)


The source code for the translation is located at [tensai-bakabon-sms-en](https://github.com/romh-acking/tensai-bakabon-sms-en).

## Fonts
The logo (in-game and in the manual) uses two fonts:
* "The genius": Samurai Warrior
* "Bakabon": Taped Up Tight

Everything else uses "A-OTF Shin Go Pro". This is a standard Japanese font you commonly see in video game font (or at least ones extremely close to it).
